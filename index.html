		<h2>Wants to go Tech</h2>

		<p class="sub-title">How did I get here?</p>

		<p>Earlier this summer, I applied for the education programme Discover Tech, organised by Riga TechGirls. Back then, I was not quite sure of the direction I wanted to go and joined mainly out of curiosity.
      But to my surprise, I was quickly hooked and soon realised that each new learning session offered great hints about topics I would like to explore more.</p>

		<p>For the past three years, I have been a self-employed translator (though I have done quite a lot of professional soul-searching beforehand as well).
      Although I have enjoyed working with languages and the flexibility that comes with freelancing, I am eager to find something I could be really passionate about and to work with people who are genuinely inspired by what they do.</p>

    <p>Also, considering the fast-paced development of machine translation engines and AI, translators might become an endangered species in the not-too-distant future. So, learning a new “language” that could step-up my game seemed like a great idea.</p>

    <p class="sub-title">Why front-end?</p>

		<p>While Discovering Tech, I started to explore several IT fields that caught my attention. QA and UX/UI design were the first ones that spoke to me, but after taking up some online courses I quickly discovered that I am more interested in the building process, rather than scrutinising an existing product developed by others. Moreover, I enjoy creative problem-solving and the interactive side of web design where there is plenty of space to think outside the box, which consequentially lead me towards the front-end world.</p>

		<p>Since November, I have been learning responsive web design (HTML and CSS) independently through freeCodeCamp and a great educational app called Mimo. Some of the practical exercises I have completed during this time can be found on my <a href="https://codepen.io/ledene" target="_blank">CodePen profile</a>. Just recently, I also started to familiarise myself with the basics of JavaScript. I know this is just the beginning and there is still so much to learn, but I am definitely ready to rise to this challenge.</p>

		<p class="sub-title">Why am I applying for She Goes Tech?</p>

		<p>Of course, starting a totally new career (yet again) seems a bit daunting and at times I feel overwhelmed by everything that has been piling up in my to do-/read-/learn-list, but I believe that collective learning is the key to overcoming these obstacles. All the more so, because great work usually is not created in isolation. I have heard only great feedback about this training programme, which offers a well-structured curriculum and collaborative hands-on projects for its participants, and it seems like a natural next step.</p>

		<p>To conclude this rather extended version of application, I would truly appreciate the opportunity to continue this journey together with you by being a part of this encouraging movement.</p>
